I am not the first to admire [James Joyceâ€™s Paean to Water](https://medicine-opera.com/2010/01/james-joyces-pean-to-water/){target="ext"}. This ode to water is sublime as it is, but I could not resist the temptation to try to identify and link the text with the water-based ecosystems on the ecosphere.

Here is my contribution and modest tribute to a great writer.

> What in water did Bloom, waterlover, drawer of water, watercarrier, returning to the range, admire?

> Its universality: its democratic equality and constancy to its nature in seeking its own level: its vastness in the ocean^[Most probably referring to the whole <a href='https://global-ecosystems.org/explore/biomes/M2' target='typology'>M2 Pelagic ocean waters biome</a>] of Mercator's projection: its unplumbed profundity in the Sundam trench^[The deepest ecosystems in the marine floor are the <a href='https://global-ecosystems.org/explore/groups/M3.6' target='typology'>M3.6 Hadal trenches and troughs</a>] of the Pacific exceeding 8,000 fathoms: the restlessness of its waves and surface particles visiting in turn all points of its seaboard^[The surface of the ocean is part of the<a href='https://global-ecosystems.org/explore/groups/M2.1' target='typology'>M2.1 Epipelagic ocean waters</a>]: the independence of its units: the variability of states of sea: its hydrostatic quiescence in calm: its hydrokinetic turgidity in neap and spring tides: its subsidence after devastation: its sterility in the circumpolar icecaps^[Part of the <a href='https://global-ecosystems.org/explore/groups/T6.1' target='typology'>T6.1 Ice sheets, glaciers and perennial snowfields</a>], arctic and antarctic: its climatic and commercial significance: its preponderance of 3 to 1 over the dry land of the globe: its indisputable hegemony extending in square leagues over all the region below the subequatorial tropic of Capricorn: the multisecular stability of its primeval basin^[I guess this refers to the <a href='https://global-ecosystems.org/explore/biomes/M3' target='typology'>M3 Deep sea floors biome</a>] : its luteofulvous bed: its capacity to dissolve and hold in solution all soluble substances including millions of tons of the most precious metals: its slow erosions of peninsulas and islands, its persistent formation of homothetic islands, peninsulas and downwardtending promontories: its alluvial deposits: its weight and volume and density: its imperturbability in lagoons and highland tarns: its gradation of colours in the torrid and temperate and frigid zones: its vehicular ramifications in continental lakecontained streams and confluent oceanflowing rivers with their tributaries and transoceanic currents, gulfstream, north and south equatorial courses: its violence in seaquakes, waterspouts, Artesian wells^[<a href='https://global-ecosystems.org/explore/groups/F2.8' target='typology'>F2.8 Artesian springs and oases</a>], eruptions, torrents, eddies, freshets, spates, groundswells, watersheds, waterpartings, geysers^[<a href='https://global-ecosystems.org/explore/groups/F2.9' target='typology'>F2.9 Geothermal pools and wetlands</a>], cataracts, whirlpools, maelstroms, inundations^[Mostly in <a href='https://global-ecosystems.org/explore/groups/TF1.4' target='typology'>TF1.4 Seasonal floodplain marshes</a> but also in <a href='https://global-ecosystems.org/explore/groups/TF1.5' target='typology'>TF1.5 Episodic arid floodplains</a>], deluges, cloudbursts: its vast circumterrestrial ahorizontal curve: its secrecy in springs and latent humidity, revealed by rhabdomantic or hygrometric instruments and exemplified by the hole in the wall at Ashtown gate, saturation of air, distillation of dew: the simplicity of its composition, two constituent parts of hydrogen with one constituent part of oxygen: its healing virtues: its buoyancy in the waters of the Dead Sea^[<a href='https://global-ecosystems.org/explore/groups/F2.6' target='typology'>F2.6 Permanent salt and soda lakes</a>]: its persevering penetrativeness in runnels, gullies, inadequate dams^[Most dramatic in <a href='https://global-ecosystems.org/explore/groups/F3.1' target='typology'>F3.1 Large reservoirs</a>, but more commonly in <a href='https://global-ecosystems.org/explore/groups/F3.2' target='typology'>F3.2 Constructed lacustrine wetlands</a> or in <a href='https://global-ecosystems.org/explore/groups/F3.5' target='typology'>F3.5 Canals, ditches and drains</a>], leaks on shipboard: its properties for cleansing, quenching thirst and fire, nourishing vegetation: its infallibility as paradigm and paragon: its metamorphoses as vapour, mist, cloud, rain, sleet, snow, hail: its strength in rigid hydrants: its variety of forms in loughs and bays and gulfs and bights and guts and lagoons and atolls and archipelagos and sounds and fjords^[<a href='https://global-ecosystems.org/explore/groups/FM1.3' target='typology'>FM1.1 Deepwater coastal inlets</a>] and minches and tidal estuaries^[<a href='https://global-ecosystems.org/explore/groups/MFT1.1' target='typology'>MFT1.1 Coastal river deltas</a>] and arms of sea: its solidity in glaciers, icebergs, icefloes^[Referring here to the <a href='https://global-ecosystems.org/explore/groups/T6.1' target='typology'>T6.1 Ice sheets, glaciers and perennial snowfields</a> and <a href='https://global-ecosystems.org/explore/groups/M2.5' target='typology'>M2.5 sea ice</a>]: its docility in working hydraulic millwheels, turbines, dynamos, electric power stations, bleachworks, tanneries, scutchmills: its utility in canals, rivers, if navigable^[All of <a href='https://global-ecosystems.org/explore/groups/F1.7' target='typology'>F1.7 Large rivers</a> and some in the rest of the <a href='https://global-ecosystems.org/explore/biomes/F1' target='typology'>F1 Rivers and streams biome</a>], floating and graving docks: its potentiality derivable from harnessed tides or watercourses falling from level to level: its submarine fauna and flora (anacoustic, photophobe), numerically, if not literally, the inhabitants of the globe: its ubiquity as constituting 90% of the human body: the noxiousness of its effluvia in lacustrine marshes^[<a href='https://global-ecosystems.org/explore/groups/TF1.3' target='typology'>TF1.3 Permanent marshes</a>], pestilential fens^[<a href='https://global-ecosystems.org/explore/groups/TF1.7' target='typology'>TF1.7 Boreal and temperate fens</a>], faded flowerwater, stagnant pools in the waning moon.
